# challenge-card-game-becode
First BeCode project - creating a card game in Python.

# Description
The goal of this exercise is to create a card game in Python. This is a beginner's project to help learn the student understand Object Oriented Programming in Python,
pushing and pulling with Github and to think things through step by step.

In this, players play a small card game by playing one card per turn untill their hand is empty.

# Installation

To use this code you need to have Python 3.0+ and any IDE and text editor, some examples are:

vscode (IDE/Text editor)
PyCharm (IDE)
Atom (Text editor)
Sublime Text (Text editor)
vim (Text editor)
Spyder (IDE/Text editor)

It's not advised to use this in a Jupyter notebook.

# Usage

The game starts simple by running the main.py file. This will then prompt the user to input the amount of players as well as their names.
The game then proceeds to distribute cards from the deck as evenly as possible. Players then play one card per turn untill they run out of cards to play.

# Timeline

This was a beginners learning project and so the timeline for this was 3 days to completion. As you can see, I didn't quite get there but it was a good and fun exercise.

# Personal situation

At time of writing, I'm a junior data scientist at BeCode and only starting my 3rd week in this journey.
